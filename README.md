I used NFLFastR to pull the open source data for this kicking analysis.
You can skip to line 50 and run that chunk to load in a local version of the data attached here instead of waiting to source the original df, just be sure to load in packages.
Currently working on a bug for the missing kicker id's.....the kickers exist in the df and I'm trying to clean those up before I start imputing values for the indoor stadium temp/wind vars.
