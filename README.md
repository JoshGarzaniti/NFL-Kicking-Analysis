I used NFLFastR to pull the open source data for this kicking analysis.
You can skip to the NFL Kicker Analysis Post Cleaning RMD and run that file. The Cleaning file is the initial data collection from NFLFastR and the steps I took to scrub the data for analysis. (I will still inlcude those files in here). The only file you need for the Post Cleaning analysis is the pbp_complete.csv file.
